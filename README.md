## What is it ?

This repository hosts a comprehensive guide to implementing DevOps in large organizations, addressing the challenges from fostering cultural shifts to navigating technical and HR transformations.

_Scaling Institutions with DevOps_ was written from [my](https://berwick.fr) SRE/DevOps experience to benefit enthusiasts, mainly from the public sector, to overcome these technical and transformational challenges.

As a DevOps advocate, I had to make this book GitOps-compliant, this is why it is hosted here. I hope it will be **community-driven** to fill it with good resources and make improvements as practices evolve. Please contribute through _Pull Requests_ and _Discussions_.

Here are the different ways to access this writing :

- [Markdown version (FR)](./fra/README.md)
- [HTML version (FR)](https://book-devops.berwick.fr)
- Ebook version (FR) (soon)
- Hardcover book (FR) (soon)

## Summary

Numerous organizations have embarked on their journey towards digital transformation, yet find themselves grappling to carve out a coherent and potent strategy. In this quest for advancement, they often turn to a plethora of experts, harboring hopes of achieving success.

Confronted with the imperative necessity to evolve and sustain their operational momentum, a pervasive sense of fatalism begins to take hold. In this milieu, the DevOps movement emerges as a beacon of hope. Rooted in the principles that govern the world's most successful and expansive organizations, DevOps seeks to provide viable solutions to these pressing challenges.

This book is designed to be your gateway to understanding this transformative movement, which has found its stronghold in the largest and most prosperous organizations of the world.

Designed to be both accessible and insightful, this hands-on guide, enriched with illustrations, unfolds the opportunities that state-of-the-art DevOps technologies and methodologies have to offer. It demystifies the prerequisites for organizational adaptation and guides you on embarking on your own DevOps transformation, at any scale.

## Purpose

This book is filled with recommendations about DevOps practices, including versioning everything you do : from documentation, presentations, to infrastructure recipes (IaC). So this repo is a perfect illustration of how it can be done !

I believe the practice of writing a book the gitops-style is not a bad move : it's portable, iterative, open and automatable. Of course, it's far fetched for the use case, but this is a funny way to illustrate the methodology.

_That said, this way of writing is very convenient for not being annoyed by compatibility issues when I switch from my Windows to my Linux PC._

It automatically :

<!-- - [Checks spells](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/blob/main/.github/workflows/spelling.yml) of english-written texts -->
- [Validates Markdown](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/markdown-linting-action) format
- Renders a PDF version on _develop_ and _main_
- [Updates](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) the Amazon physical version book through their API

This repo uses a [trunk-based git workflow](./fra/README.md#workflows-git) with releases automatically triggering optional actions.
