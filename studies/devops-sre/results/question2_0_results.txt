Question : Regarding jobs descriptions you've seen and focusing on jobs missions and requirements, is there a difference between DevOps and SRE positions ?

Yes, there is a difference between DevOps and SRE positions. DevOps focuses on integrating development and operations through collaboration and automation to optimize the software development lifecycle. SRE, or Site Reliability Engineering, originated from Google and emphasizes on automating operations and measuring reliability through a set of well-defined metrics, often taking on a more specialized role in ensuring the reliability and scalability of complex, large-scale systems. SREs typically work to automate away operations work and adhere to a set of principles that treat operations problems as software problems. While there is overlap, SRE tends to be more focused on site reliability and system health, while DevOps encompasses a broader approach to continuous integration and deployment.
